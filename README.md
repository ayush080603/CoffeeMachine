# ☕ Coffee Machine Project

This is a simple command-line Coffee Machine simulation built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The user can order coffee (latte, espresso, or cappuccino), insert virtual coins, and the machine will handle transactions, check resources, and serve the drink.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Terminal/Command-Line interface

---

## 🚀 Features

- Order from 3 types of coffee: `espresso`, `latte`, or `cappuccino`
- Simulated coin input (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies)
- Calculates total inserted money and returns change if applicable
- Checks if ingredients are sufficient for the selected coffee
- Tracks resources and handles unavailable options
- Built fully in Python using OOP principles with modular classes:
  - `Menu`
  - `CoffeeMaker`
  - `MoneyMachine`
